# ⚙️ PHP DSL Converter (from `.ephp` to `.php`)

> ✨ A lightweight, smart DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that compiles `.ephp` files into modern, readable PHP — helping you write PHP faster, cleaner, and more pythonic 🐍➡️🐘

---

## 🚀 What is this?
This is a simple DSL that allows you to write `.ephp` files (inspired by Python syntax) and convert them to standard PHP code.

**Yes! You can write Python-style code that becomes valid PHP!**

No need to worry about `{}` or `$` or even boilerplate functions. Just focus on logic — this tool handles the transformation.

---

## ✅ Features
- [x] `func` keyword for PHP functions (with type hints and default values)
- [x] `with ... as ...:` context blocks (auto fclose on file handles)
- [x] `match ...:` expressions with `case`, `default`, assignment or `return`
- [x] `do:` and `while ...` structure
- [x] `for x in range(...)` and `for x in collection:` loops
- [x] Inline ternary expressions
- [x] Anonymous functions: `x = fn(...) => ...` and multiline ones too
- [x] Python-like expressions (`a and b`, `not`, `True`, `len(x)` → `count($x)`, etc.)
- [x] F-Strings: `f"Hello {name}!"` → `"Hello " . $name . "!"`
- [x] Auto `$` handling
- [x] Constants with `UPPER_CASE = value`
- [x] Native PHP support inside `.ephp` files
- [x] Readable, pretty formatted PHP output

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- [ ] IntelliSense / language extension for VS Code
- [ ] Syntax highlighting
- [ ] Better error handling and CLI feedback
- [ ] `class` / OOP support (currently not planned)
- [ ] Support for `try-except` blocks
- [ ] More advanced list and dict operations

## 📦 Example

### `example.ephp`
```python
import "utils.ephp"

func greet(name = "World") str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

name = input("Enter your name:")
print(greet(name))
```

### ➡️ Will be converted to:
```php
<?php
// Generated by DSL to PHP converter
require_once "utils.php";

function greet(string $name = "World"): string {
    return "Hello, " . $name . "!";
}

$name = readline("Enter your name:");
echo greet($name);
```

---

## 📚 Syntax Examples

### 🧮 Assignments & Expressions
```python
x = 10
name = input("Your name:")
greeting = f"Hi, {name}"
```

➡️
```php
$x = 10;
$name = readline("Your name:");
$greeting = "Hi, " . $name;
```

### 🌀 Loops & Conditionals
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

if x > 5:
    print("Big")
else:
    print("Small")
```

➡️
```php
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i += 1) {
    echo $i;
}
if ($x > 5) {
    echo "Big";
} else {
    echo "Small";
}
```

### 🔀 Match Expressions
```python
result = match x:
    case 1: "One"
    case 2 or 3: "Two or Three"
    default: "Other"
```

➡️
```php
$result = match ($x) {
    1 => "One",
    2, 3 => "Two or Three",
    default => "Other",
};
```

## 🧠 Who built this?
This entire project — including this README — was built with the help of **ChatGPT** and **DeepSeek AI** 🤖

We used AI assistance to prototype, refine, and ship this converter faster.

---

## 🙏 Contribute!
This DSL is meant to **simplify PHP development** and boost productivity. However, it’s still a **work in progress**.

If you’re a PHP developer or just love compilers / syntax tools, we’d love your help!

### Why contribute?
- Help build a **minimal, powerful PHP DSL**
- Learn about DSLs, code parsing, AST-like transforms
- Make PHP more fun and friendly

> PRs are welcome. Bug reports too. Let’s make PHP great again 😄

---

## 📝 Notes
- You can directly use any **native PHP functions** in `.ephp` files.
- It **won’t touch** those lines — they'll be passed as-is.
- Currently, **IntelliSense** and **syntax highlighting** in editors like VSCode are **not available**.
    - You can help by building a VSCode extension for `.ephp`

---

## 📂 Usage
```bash
python php_dsl.py file.ephp
# OR
python php_dsl.py file.ephp output.php
```

## 💡 Pro Tip
Use `.ephp` to prototype your PHP logic faster. Once ready, convert it to `.php` and deploy with confidence!
